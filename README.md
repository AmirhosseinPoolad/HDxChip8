# HDxChip8
CHIP-8 Interpreter with C and SDL2

# About
CHIP-8 is an interpreted language that was used in some microcomputers in mid 70's such as the COSMAC VIP. Users bought magazines that contained CHIP-8 code of some game/program and typed it in the machine to play the game. Nowadays writing a CHIP-8 emulator is considered as a good first step to get started in emulation development. This is my first (and hopefully not last) step.

# How To Compile
The only dependency is SDL2. You can use the cmake configuration if you're on linux, simply install SDL2 with this command (Or the appropriate command for your distro):
> sudo apt install libsdl2-dev

Windows users can use [this](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php) guide.

# How To Use
Search "CHIP-8 Roms", download a rom and give the address of it to the program.
